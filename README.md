# react-video-jockey
I like to dj as a hobby. Sometimes for friends in person and sometimes on twitch. I really want to make an interactive 
web page where I can load videos and assign them to different keys, which will play on the full screen when I press that assigned key,
similar to how djs have various graphics appear for different songs

Potential upgrades later:
1. ability to connect to audio source, react to music?
2. effects on videos? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_manipulation https://github.com/mdn/webgl-examples
3. Insertion of various webgl exampoles? https://webglsamples.org/aquarium/aquarium.html
